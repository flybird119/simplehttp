INSTALL INSTRUCTIONS
====================

to install any of the simplehttp components you will need to install 
libevent 1.4 and the 'server' module first.

libevent 1.4 can be downloaded from http://www.monkey.org/~provos/libevent/

# build the main library
# this provides libsimplehttp.a simplehttp/simplehttp.h and simplehttp/queue.h
export LIBEVENT=/usr/local
cd server
make && make install

# now install whichever module you would like
# this will compile 'simplequeue' and place it in $LIBEVENT/bin
cd ../simplequeue
make && make install
